# Email-Spam-Classifier
Developed a real-time Email Spam Classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The project involved end-to-end implementation including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. A Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) model was trained, achieving 97.1% accuracy and 100% precision, ensuring highly reliable spam detection. The model was serialized using Pickle (.pkl) and deployed through a Streamlit web application, enabling users to classify emails via an interactive and user-friendly interface. The project was built using Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit, and Anaconda.
